    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
        <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>⅓ pound finely ground pork</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar (Optional)</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger (Optional)/li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the bread crumbs into a small bowl, and <br>
            mix in the cream. Allow to stand until crumbs <br>
            absorb the cream, about 10 minutes. While the bread <br>
            is soaking, melt 1 teaspoon of butter in a skillet <br>
            over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion until <br>
            it turns light brown, about 10 minutes. Place onion <br>
            into a mixing bowl; mix with the ground beef, <br>
            ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, <br>
            nutmeg, allspice, and ginger. Lightly mix in the <br>
            bread crumbs and cream.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over <br>
            medium heat. Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon of <br>
            the meat mixture per meatball, and form into balls. <br>
            Place the meatballs into the skillet, and cook just <br>
            until the outsides are brown, about 5 minutes, <br>
            turning the meatballs often. Insides of the meatballs <br>
            will still be pink. Place browned meatballs into a <br>
            baking dish, pour in chicken broth, and cover with foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the meatballs are tender, <br>
            about 40 minutes. Remove meatballs to a serving dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make brown gravy, pour pan drippings into a saucepan <br>
            over medium heat. Whisk the flour into the pan drippings <br>
            until smooth, and gradually whisk in enough beef broth to <br>
            total about 2 1/2 cups of liquid. Bring the gravy to a simmer, <br>
            whisking constantly until thick, about 5 minutes. <br>
            Just before serving, whisk in the sour cream. <br>
            Season to taste with salt and black pepper. <br>
            Serve the gravy with the meatballs.
